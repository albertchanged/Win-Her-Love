### From [Albert Chang](http://www.albertchanged.me):

In this Frogger-esque JavaScript game, you are a courageous fellow who crosses a bug-infested road to earn hearts from a Princess.

Your character has unlimited lives and resets his position for every round.

Use your keyboard arrows to move up, down, left, and right. 

You earn 50 points for each heart granted by the Princess.

But watch out! You also lose 25 points for every water and bug encounter.

### TO BEAT THIS GAME AND WIN HER LOVE, you must accumulate 1000 points.

### From Udacity:

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
